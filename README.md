**📜 Quote App
🛠️ Getting Started**
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

**📌 Overview**
The Quote App is a dynamic React application that fetches random quotes from an external API and displays them in an interactive card. The app also shows the current time and indicates whether it's day or night with a 🌞 or 🌜 emoji.

**🚀 Available Scripts**
In the project directory, you can run:

▶️ npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see lint errors in the console.
🧪 npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

🏗️ npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
⚠️ npm run eject
🚨 Warning: This is a one-way operation! Once you eject, you cannot go back.

This command removes the single build dependency from your project.
It copies configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control.
You don't have to use eject unless you want deep customization.
